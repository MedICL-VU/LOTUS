# LOTUS: Latent Outpainting Diffusion Model for Three-Dimensional Ultrasound Stitching
Thank you for your interest in this project!

Our work has been accepted by MIDL 2025. We appreciate your patience and support!

Here we released our training/inference code for LOTUS (autoenc_aug_training.py, 3D_ldm_training.py, lotus_outpaint_evaluation.ipynb) and RePaint in 3D version (3D_ddpm_placenta_training.py, RePaint3D_inference.ipynb).

Our code is mainly based on MONAI (https://github.com/Project-MONAI).

For any inquiries, feel free to reach out. Stay tuned for updates!
