# LOTUS: Latent Outpainting Diffusion Model for Three-Dimensional Ultrasound Stitching
Thank you for your interest in this project!

Our work is currently under review at MIDL 2025. We appreciate your patience and support!

Here we released our training/inference code for LOTUS (autoenc_aug_training.py, 3D_ldm_training.py, lotus_outpaint_evaluation.ipynb) and RePaint in 3D version (3D_ddpm_placenta_training.py, RePaint3D_inference.ipynb).

Our code is mainly based on MONAI (https://github.com/Project-MONAI).

For any inquiries, feel free to reach out. Stay tuned for updates!
